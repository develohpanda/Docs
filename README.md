Documentation and guidance repository

The pages in this repository cover general concepts, standards and recommendations for developers within Intergen. 
The intent with these documents is to create a continuously-evolving standard against which developers should begin projects and 
approach common architectures.

The expectation is not to create a restrictive or highly-constrained set of rules for software development projects, but to build 
out a common set of proven technologies, platforms, tools and processes that form the basis for new solutions as well as providing 
discussion points towards the recommendation of new additions to this list. Through adopting known technologies and approaching 
client work using previously-used toolsets, clients can expect more predictable outcomes, Intergenites can expect a better pool of 
resources for help and guidance and Intergen can drive more cost-effective development effort through efficient delivery of code.

These documents will outline:
* Softare Platforms (the high-level categories of technologies we build on, e.g. Azure, JavaScript, Xamarin, etc)
* Tools (the applications used to deliver products, e.g. source control, build management, IDEs)
* Processes (the methodologies, project and communication standards we base our delivery from)
* Philosophies (the overarching ideals against which we base our decisions around the choices of the above three topics)

The documents are open to expansion but it is expected that where Intergen is being put in a position of having to adopt and 
support a new technology or toolset, those tasked with its adoption are given adequate opportunity to discuss and understand the 
implications.
